In programming, we use loops to iterate over data. This can be useful for
transforming individual elements in an array, validating input data, sorting,
and many other things. PHP offers several methods for looping over data arrays.

#### “for” Loops

The `for` loop offers space for up to three parameters: the initial value, the
condition, and the increment. In practice, this means that you can do things
like counting very easily using `for` loops. The code:

    $i = 0;

    for($i; $i < 4; $i++) {
       echo $i . PHP_EOL;
    }

Will output this when [run in the command
line](https://medium.com/shiphp/writing-a-php-command-line-script-31073babdef):

    0
    1
    2
    3

What’s happening is that before PHP executes the block of code within the
`for(...) { }` brackets, it’s checking if the conditional is true, then
executing the code, then applying the iterative function (`$i++` in this case).
That way, the next time PHP executes the block, it’s checking if `$i < 4` and it
won’t run indefinitely.

Be careful though. You can easily write an infinite loop by omitting that last
parameter, and it might cause your computer to run out of memory and crash.

#### “foreach” Loops

If you want to [iterate over an
array](https://medium.com/shiphp/working-with-arrays-in-php-71f45c80ea92) (ie:
take each element in the array and do an operation on it), then a `foreach` loop
might be your best bet.

    $array = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

    foreach($array as $key => $value) {
      echo $value . PHP_EOL;
    }

The code above will output `a b c d` (with each character on a new line) when
run in a command line terminal.

#### “while” Loops

The `while` loop is similar to PHP’s `for` loop, but instead of taking three
arguments, it just takes one: a condition.

The `while` loop will test that condition and as long as it is true, it will
execute code within the loop. For example, this code:

    $j = 0;

    while($j < 4) {
      echo $j . PHP_EOL;
      $j++;
    }

Will output the same thing as the `for` loop example above (`0 1 2 3`), but it
allows you to put the iteration function anywhere within (or even outside) this
block of code.

#### “do…while” Loops

Finally, `do...while` loops are just like `while` loops with the conditional
check moved to the end of the block. This can be useful if you always want to
execute a block once, but you’re not certain you’ll want it to run again.

A simple example would be the following code:

    $j = 0;

    do {
      echo $j . PHP_EOL;
      $j++;
    } while ($j < 4);

Which will output the same thing as our `for` and `while` examples above (`0 1 2
3`).
