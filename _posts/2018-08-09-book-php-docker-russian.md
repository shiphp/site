It's been almost a year exactly since I first published [_Building PHP Applications in Docker_](/books#building-php-applications-in-docker), and today I'm excited to announce that it is [now available in Russian](https://leanpub.com/first-php-docker-application-ru)!

I can't take any credit for this translation; [Alexey Pyltsyn](https://leanpub.com/u/lex111) reached out and generously offered to do the translation for free. Since I don't speak Russian, I can't verify the accuracy of Alexey's work, but he's put his [translation on Github](https://github.com/shiphp/docker-book-ru), so if you find any errors, feel free to make a PR there. We're both really excited that the book will now be able to reach even more people across the world, so thanks again Alexey!

You can get a coupon code to download the English and Russian copies of the book **for free** from [the books page](/books), or you can [purchase the books on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/karllhughes).
