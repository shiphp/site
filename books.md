## Building PHP Applications in Docker

#### A **FREE** Step By Step Guide for PHP Developers Learning Docker

Docker has quickly become the container engine of choice, and it may be replacing a virtual machine near you soon. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of building a real PHP web application using Docker while explaining the basics of the platform along the way.

The application we build in this eBook will do many of the key things web developers need to do on a daily basis, including:

- Installing dependencies using Composer.
- Getting data from a third-party API.
- Saving data to a MySQL database.
- Using a web framework (SlimPHP) for routing.
- Storing environmental variables securely.
- And more!

Once you've completed this book, you'll be ready for more advanced topics covered in our [courses](/courses).
