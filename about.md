My name is Karl and I've been building PHP web applications for the past six years. Like many PHP developers, I'm mostly self-taught and started out just hacking around on Wordpress sites. Since those early days, I've had a lot of great teachers and mentors, but I've also read a lot of books and completed dozens of tutorials.

A couple years ago, I took on the task of learning Docker, but I realized there weren't many great resources for PHP developers just starting out with it. After struggling for a while, I eventually found my footing, and now that I've been using Docker exclusively for local developer and to ship many projects, I've put together this site as a resource for other developers looking to learn it.

In addition to [building a comprehensive course on Docker for PHP developers](/courses), I've also released an [eBook](/books), and am offering [corporate training](/training) for companies that want hands-on help. Check back on this site often because I post weekly blog posts that could be a great resource for PHP developers looking to get a leg up on Docker.

If you have feedback or suggestions, please [contact me](/contact). Thanks for visiting!
