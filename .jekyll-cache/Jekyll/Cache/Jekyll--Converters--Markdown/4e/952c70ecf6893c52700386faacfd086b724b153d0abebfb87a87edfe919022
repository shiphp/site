I"Ò<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> is a great database for getting started on small projects. Unlike traditional SQL databases (like <a href="https://www.shiphp.com/blog/2017/php-mysql-docker">MySQL</a> or <a href="https://www.shiphp.com/blog/2017/php-postgres-docker">Postgres</a>), SQLite stores all your records in a single flat file that you can easily edit, transfer, or even check into version control (if your project warrants it).</p>
