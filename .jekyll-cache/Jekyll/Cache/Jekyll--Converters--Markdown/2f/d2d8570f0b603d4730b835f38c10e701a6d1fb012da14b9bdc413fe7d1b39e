I"“<p>Over the past month, Iâ€™ve been talking to other developers who work with PHP and Docker about the tools and resources they use to make managing Docker easier. This week, Iâ€™m sharing a short interview with Italo Baeza, the creator of <a href="https://github.com/DarkGhostHunter/Shipyard">Laravel Shipyard</a>, an open source project that helps Laravel developers (and really all PHP developers) get a whole local environment set up using Docker. Like <a href="/blog/2017/mahmoud-zalt-laradock">Laradock</a>, Shipyard abstracts away most of the Docker complexity and makes running containers secondary to writing code, but Shipyard is a bit simpler.</p>
