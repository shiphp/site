<p>My name is Karl and I spent almost 10 years as a PHP developer, architect, and team leader. Like many PHP devs, I’m mostly self-taught and started out just hacking around on WordPress sites. Since those early days, I’ve had a lot of great teachers, launched production-quality web applications, read a number of books, and completed more tutorials than I can count.</p>

<p>A couple years ago, I took on the task of learning Docker, but I realized there weren’t many great resources for PHP developers just starting out with it. After struggling for a while, I eventually found my footing, and now that I’ve been using Docker exclusively for local developer and to ship many projects, I’ve put together this site as a resource for other developers looking to learn it.</p>

<p>Now my team and I write regular tutorials and high-level guides about PHP application development and deployment. Whether you use Docker or not, I hope this site will be one of your go-to resources for all things web development!</p>
