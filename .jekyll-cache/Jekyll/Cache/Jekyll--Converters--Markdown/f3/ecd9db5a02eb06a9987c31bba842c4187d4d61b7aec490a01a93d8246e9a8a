<p>My name is Karl and Iâ€™ve been building PHP web applications for the past six years. Like many PHP developers, Iâ€™m mostly self-taught and started out just hacking around on Wordpress sites. Since those early days, Iâ€™ve had a lot of great teachers, launched production-quality web applications, read a number of books, and completed more tutorials than I can count.</p>

<p>A couple years ago, I took on the task of learning Docker, but I realized there werenâ€™t many great resources for PHP developers just starting out with it. After struggling for a while, I eventually found my footing, and now that Iâ€™ve been using Docker exclusively for local developer and to ship many projects, Iâ€™ve put together this site as a resource for other developers looking to learn it.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="/#blog">blog on this site</a>, Iâ€™ve also released an <a href="/books">eBook</a>, and am offering <a href="/training">in-person training</a> for companies that want hands-on help. Check back on this site often because I post weekly blog posts that could be a great resource for PHP developers looking to get a leg up on Docker.</p>

<p>If you have feedback or suggestions, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>. Thanks for visiting!</p>
