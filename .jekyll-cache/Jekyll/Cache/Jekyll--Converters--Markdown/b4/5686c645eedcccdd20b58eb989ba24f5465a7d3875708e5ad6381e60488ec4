I"†<p>Itâ€™s been almost a year exactly since I first published <a href="/books#building-php-applications-in-docker"><em>Building PHP Applications in Docker</em></a>, and today Iâ€™m excited to announce that it is <a href="https://leanpub.com/first-php-docker-application-ru">now available in Russian</a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MydyeXx.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I canâ€™t take any credit for this translation; <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/lex111">Alexey Pyltsyn</a> reached out and generously offered to do the translation for free. Since I donâ€™t speak Russian, I canâ€™t verify the accuracy of Alexeyâ€™s work, but heâ€™s put his <a href="https://github.com/shiphp/docker-book-ru">translation on Github</a>, so if you find any errors, feel free to make a PR there. Weâ€™re both really excited that the book will now be able to reach even more people across the world, so thanks again Alexey!</p>

<p>You can get a coupon code to download the English and Russian copies of the book <strong>for free</strong> from <a href="/books">the books page</a>, or you can <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/karllhughes">purchase the books on Leanpub</a>.</p>
